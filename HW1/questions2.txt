8. Given the program files main.c, circle.h and circle.c:

    a.) What commands will compile the source files into object files?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -c main.c circle.c    
    b.) What command will link the object files
        into an executable named broken?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    gcc -o broken main.c circle.c    
    c.) Why does the program compile but fail to link?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    the method getAreas() in circle.c was defined only in circle.c and was incorecctly
    referenced as the method "getArea()" from circle.h. In order to link them, getAreas()
    needed to be renamed to getArea() as it is in the header file.
